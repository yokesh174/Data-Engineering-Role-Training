A company wants a simple staffing database. There are departments (with an ID, name,
location) and staff (with an ID, name, age, salary). Some staff may not belong to any
department yet, and some departments may currently have no staff. Your task (as
learners) after setup: write queries to explore the data, perform joins, and analyze
edge cases where results contain NULL values.

— Create DB, Tables, and Insert Seed Data
Copy–paste into MySQL. This guarantees:
.At least two departments without staff
.At least two staff without a department (NULL dept_id)
.Multiple staff in the same department (for grouping/joins)
