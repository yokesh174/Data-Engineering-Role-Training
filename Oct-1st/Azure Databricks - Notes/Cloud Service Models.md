## Topic
On-Premises vs IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS

## Description
Cloud computing provides different service models where responsibilities are divided between the user and the provider.

## Models

### On-Premises
- You manage everything: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking.  

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- You manage: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS.  
- Provider manages: Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking.  

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- You manage: Applications, Data.  
- Provider manages: Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking.  

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Provider manages everything: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking.  

## Summary
- **On-Premises** → Full control, full responsibility.  
- **IaaS** → You control software, provider handles infrastructure.  
- **PaaS** → You focus on applications and data only.  
- **SaaS** → Everything managed by the provider.
