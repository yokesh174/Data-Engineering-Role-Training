## On-Prem vs Cloud – Comparison

| Criteria              | On-Prem (Servers)                          | Cloud (VMs / App Service)              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Initial Setup**     | 2 physical servers (Feb) + 3 servers (Apr–Aug) | 2 VMs + 2 App Service servers (Feb)    |
| **Approvals**         | Requires approvals from Directors, CEO, COO | Same approvals, but faster deployment  |
| **Procurement**       | EX:Hardware from Germany - 2 weeks delay         | No physical procurement – instant setup|
| **Networking**        | 3 teams + 1 backup team (24/7 work)        | Handled by cloud provider              |
| **Power Supply**      | Continuous supply needed (CTC managed)     | Not needed (cloud provider handles it) |
| **Room Rent**         | Server room rent required                  | Not needed                             |
| **Scalability**       | Manual addition of servers                 | Elastic scaling (automatic scale up/down) |
| **Cost Impact**       | Hardware + Rent + Power + Team salary      | Pay-as-you-go, flexible cost            |
| **Deployment Speed**  | Weeks or months                            | Hours or days                          |

### **Summary**
- **On-Prem** – higher cost, longer setup, more maintenance required on our side.  
- **Cloud** – faster setup, flexible scaling, lower operational overhead, maintenance handled by the provider.
